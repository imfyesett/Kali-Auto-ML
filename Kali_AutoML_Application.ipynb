Given the relatively small dataset size, external parallelization of data loading/preprocessing is unlikely to show significant gains compared to the inherent parallelism in model training. Therefore, for this specific subtask context (optimizing for Intel i9 using provided libraries on this dataset), the primary method for leveraging the multi-core processor during training is already active via `n_jobs=-1`. I will now document the observations and assess the impact, as requested by steps 5 and 6 of the subtask.

        "The profiling results indicate that model training is indeed the most time-consuming part, as expected. Scikit-learn's RandomForest and XGBoost already utilize `n_jobs=-1` for internal parallelism across CPU cores during training. Given the relatively small dataset size, external parallelization of data loading/preprocessing is unlikely to show significant gains compared to the inherent parallelism in model training. Therefore, for this specific subtask context (optimizing for Intel i9 using provided libraries on this dataset), the primary method for leveraging the multi-core processor during training is already active via `n_jobs=-1`. I will now document the observations and assess the impact, as requested by steps 5 and 6 of the subtask. Since external parallelization isn't deemed beneficial for this specific scenario (small data, libraries already parallelized internally), I will focus on documenting the findings."
